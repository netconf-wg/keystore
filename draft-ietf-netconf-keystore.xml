      <section title="Introduction">
        <t>This document defines a YANG 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"/>  module called
          "ietf-keystore" that enables centralized configuration of both symmetric
          and asymmetric keys.  The secret value for both key types may be
          encrypted or hidden (see <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>).
          Asymmetric keys may be associated with certificates.  Notifications are
          sent when certificates are about to expire.</t>

        <t>The "ietf-keystore" module defines many "grouping" statements
          intended for use by other modules that may import it.  For instance,
          there are groupings that define enabling a key to be either configured
          inline (within the defining data model) or as a reference to a key
          in the keystore.
        </t>

        <t>Special consideration has been given for servers that have cryptographic
          hardware, such as a Trusted Platform Module (TPM).  These servers are
          unique in that the cryptographic hardware hides the secret key values.
          Additionally, such hardware is commonly initialized when manufactured
          to protect a "built-in" asymmetric key for which its public half is
          conveyed in an identity certificate (e.g., an IDevID
          <xref target="Std-802.1AR-2018"/> certificate).  Please see
          <xref target="built-ins"/> to see how built-in keys are supported.</t>

        <t>This document intends to support existing practices; it does not
          intend to define new behavior for servers to implement.  To simplify
          implementation, advanced key formats may be selectively implemented.</t>

        <t>Implementations may utilize zero or more operating-system level
          keystore utilities (e.g., "Keychain Access" on MacOS) and/or cryptographic
          hardware (e.g., TPMs).</t>

        <section title="Terminology">
          <t>The terms "client" and "server" are defined in <xref target="RFC6241"/> and are not redefined here.</t>
          <t>The term "keystore" is defined in this document as a mechanism that intends safeguard secrets placed
            into it for protection.</t>
          <t>The nomenclature "&lt;running&gt;" and "&lt;operational&gt;" are defined in <xref target="RFC8342"/>.</t>
          <t>The sentence fragments "augmented" and "augmented in" are used herein as the past tense verbified
            form of the "augment" statement defined in <relref section="7.17" target="RFC7950"/>.</t>
          <t>The term "key" may be used to mean one of three things in this document: 1) the YANG-defined
            "asymmetric-key" or "symmetric-key" node defined in this document, 2) the raw key data possessed by the
            aforementioned key nodes, and 3) the "key" of a YANG "list" statement.  This
            document attempts to always qualify types '2' and '3' using, "raw key value" and
            "YANG list key" where needed.  In all other cases, an unqualified "key" refers to a YANG-defined
            "asymmetric-key" or "symmetric-key" node.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Adherence to the NMDA">
          <t>This document is compliant with Network Management Datastore Architecture
            (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.  For instance, keys and associated
            certificates installed during manufacturing (e.g., for an IDevID
            certificate) are expected to appear in &lt;operational&gt;
            (see <xref target="built-ins"/>).</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Conventions">
          <t>Various examples used in this document use a placeholder
            value for binary data that has been base64 encoded (e.g.,
            "BASE64VALUE=").  This placeholder value is used as real
            base64 encoded structures are often many lines long and
            hence distracting to the example being presented.</t>

<!--
        <t>For the trusted-certificates list, Trust Anchor Format
        <xref target="RFC5914"/> was evaluated and deemed inappropriate due
        to this document's need to also support pinning.  That is, pinning
        a client-certificate to support NETCONF over TLS client authentication.</t>

      <section title="Encrypting Keys in Configuration">

        <t>This section describes an approach that enables both the symmetric
          and asymmetric keys on a server to be encrypted, such that traditional
          backup/restore procedures can be used without concern for raw key
          data being compromised when in transit.</t>

        <section title="Key Encryption Key" toc="exclude">
          <t>The ability to encrypt configured keys is predicated on the
            existence of a "key encryption key" (KEK).  There may be any
            number of KEKs in a server.  A KEK, by its namesake, is a key
            that is used to encrypt other keys. A KEK MAY be either a
            symmetric key or an asymmetric key.</t>
          <t>If a KEK is a symmetric key, then the server MUST provide an API for
            administrators to encrypt other keys without needing to know
            the symmetric key's value.  If the KEK is an asymmetric key, then
            the server MAY provide an API enabling the encryption of other
            keys or, alternatively, assume the administrators can do so themselves
            using the asymmetric key's public half.</t>
          <t>A server MUST possess (or be able to possess, in case the KEK has
            been encrypted by yet another KEK) a KEK's cleartext value so that it
            can decrypt the other keys in the configuration at runtime.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Configuring Encrypted Keys" toc="exclude">
          <t>Each time a new key is configured, it SHOULD be encrypted by
            a KEK.</t>
          <t>In "ietf-crypto-types" <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>,
            the format for encrypted values is described by identity statements
            derived from the "symmetrically-encrypted-value-format" and
            "asymmetrically-encrypted-value-format" identity statements.</t>
          <t>Implementations SHOULD provide an API that simultaneously generates
            and encrypts a key (symmetric or asymmetric) using a KEK.  Thus the
            cleartext value of the newly generated key may never be known to the
            administrators generating the keys.</t>
          <t>In case the server implementation does not provide such an API, then
            the generating and encrypting steps MAY be performed outside the
            server, e.g., by an administrator with special access control rights
            (e.g., an organization's crypto officer).</t>
          <t>In either case, the encrypted key can be configured into the keystore
            using either the "encrypted-key" (for symmetric keys) or the
            "encrypted-private-key" (for asymmetric keys) nodes.  These two nodes
            contain both the encrypted raw key value as well as a reference to
            the KEK that encrypted the key.</t>
        </section>


        <section title="Migrating Configuration to Another Server" toc="exclude">
          <t>When a KEK is used to encrypt other keys, migrating the configuration
            to another server is only possible if the second server has the same KEK.
            How the second server comes to have the same KEK is discussed in this
            section.</t>
          <t>In some deployments, mechanisms outside the scope of this document
            may be used to migrate a KEK from one server to another.  That said,
            beware that the ability to do so typically entails having access to
            the first server but, in some scenarios, the first server may no
            longer be operational.</t>
          <t>In other deployments, an organization's crypto officer, possessing a
            KEK's cleartext value, configures the same KEK on the second server,
            presumably as a hidden key or a key protected by access-control
            (e.g., NACM's "default-deny-all"), so that the cleartext value is not
            disclosed to regular administrators.  However, this approach creates
            high-coupling to and dependency on the crypto officers that does not
            scale in production environments.</t>
          <t>In order to decouple the crypto officers from the regular administrators,
            a special KEK, called the "master key" (MK), may be used.</t>
          <t>A MK is commonly a globally-unique built-in (see <xref target="built-ins"/>)
            asymmetric key. The private raw key value, due to its long lifetime, is hidden
            (i.e., "hidden-private-key" in <relref section="2.1.4.5." 
            target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>). The raw public key value is often
            contained in an identity certificate (e.g., IDevID).  How to
            configure a MK during the manufacturing process is outside the
            scope of this document.</t>
          <t>Assuming the server has a MK, the MK can be used to encrypt a
            "shared KEK", which is then used to encrypt the keys configured
            by regular administrators.</t>
          <t>With this extra level of indirection, it is possible for a
            crypto officer to encrypt the same KEK for a multiplicity of
            servers offline using the public key contained in their identity
            certificates.  The crypto officer can then safely handoff
            the encrypted KEKs to regular administrators responsible for
            server installations, including migrations.</t>
          <t>In order to migrate the configuration from a first server, an
            administrator would need to make just a single modification to
            the configuration before loading it onto a second server, which
            is to replace the encrypted KEK keystore entry from the first
            server with the encrypted KEK for the second server.  Upon doing
            this, the configuration (containing many encrypted keys) can be
            loaded into the second server while enabling the second server
            to decrypt all the encrypted keys in the configuration.</t>
          <t>The following diagram illustrates this idea:</t>

      <section title="Security Considerations">

        <section title="Security of Data at Rest">
          <t>The YANG module defined in this document defines a mechanism called a
            "keystore" that, by its name, suggests that it will protect its
            contents from unauthorized disclosure and modification.</t>
          <t>Security controls for the API (i.e., data in motion) are
            discussed in <xref target="sec-mod"/>, but controls for the
            data at rest (e.g., on disk) cannot be specified by the YANG module.</t>
          <t>In order to satisfy the expectations of a "keystore", it
            is RECOMMENDED that implementations ensure that the keystore
            contents are encrypted when persisted to non-volatile memory.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Unconstrained Private Key Usage">
          <t>This module enables the configuration of private keys without
            constraints on their usage, e.g., what operations the key is
            allowed to be used for (e.g., signature, decryption, both).</t>
          <t>This module also does not constrain the usage of the associated
            public keys, other than in the context of a configured certificate
            (e.g., an identity certificate), in which case the key usage is
            constrained by the certificate.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The &quot;ietf-keystore&quot; YANG Module" anchor="sec-mod">
          <t>The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed via YANG
            based management protocols, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and
            RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-implement
            secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual authentication.</t>

          <t>The Network Access Control Model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means
            to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of all available
            protocol operations and content.</t>

          <t>Some of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module
            may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
            environments. It is thus important to control read access
            (e.g., via get, get-config, or notification) to these
            data nodes. These are the subtrees and data nodes and
            their sensitivity/vulnerability:
            <list style="symbols">
              <t>The "cleartext-key" node:
                <ul empty="true">
                  <li>The "cleartext-key" node, imported from the "symmetric-key-grouping"
                    grouping defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/> is
                    additionally sensitive to read operations such that,
                    in normal use cases, it should never be returned to a client.
                    For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-all" was 
                    applied to it in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>.</li>
                </ul>
              </t>
              <t>The "cleartext-private-key" node:
                <ul empty="true">
                  <li>The "cleartext-private-key" node defined in the "asymmetric-key-pair-grouping"
                    grouping defined in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/> is
                    additionally sensitive to read operations such that, in
                    normal use cases, it should never be returned to a client.  For this
                    reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-all" is applied
                    to it in <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>.</li>
                </ul>
              </t>
            </list>
          </t>

          <t>All the writable data nodes defined by this module, both in the
            "grouping" statements as well as the protocol-accessible "keystore"
            instance, may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
            environments..  For instance, any modification to a key or reference
            to a key  may dramatically alter the implemented security policy.
            For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-write" has been
            set for all data nodes defined in this module.</t>

          <t>This module does not define any "rpc" or "action" statements, and
            thus the security considerations for such is not provided here.</t>

          <t>Built-in key types SHOULD be either hidden and/or encrypted (not
            cleartext).  If this is not possible, access control mechanisms
            like NACM SHOULD be used to limit access to the key's secret data
            to only the most trusted authorized clients (e.g., an organization’s
            crypto officer).</t>
