      <section title="Introduction">
        <t>This document defines a YANG 1.1 <xref target="RFC7950"/>  module called "ietf-keystore"
          that enables centralized configuration of both symmetric and
          asymmetric keys.  The secret value for both key types may be
          encrypted.  Asymmetric keys may be associated with certificates.
          Notifications are sent when certificates are about to expire.</t>

        <t>The "ietf-keystore" module defines many "grouping" statements
          intended for use by other modules that may import it.  For instance,
          there are groupings that defined enabling a key to be either configured
          locally (within the defining data model) or be a reference to a key
          in the Keystore.
        </t>

        <t>Special consideration has been given for systems that have cryptographic
          hardware, such as a Trusted Protection Module (TPM).  These systems are
          unique in that the cryptographic hardware hides the secret key values.
          To support such hardware, symmetric keys may have the value "hidden-key"
          and asymmetric keys may have the value "hidden-private-key".  While how
          such keys are created or destroyed is outside the scope of this document,
          the Keystore can contain entries for such keys, enabling them to be
          referenced by other configuration elements.</t>

        <t>It is not required that a system has an operating system level
          keystore utility, with or without HSM backing, to implement
          this module.  It is also possible that a system implementing
          the module to possess a multiplicity of operating system level
          keystore utilities and/or a multiplicity of HSMs.</t>

          <t>This document in compliant with Network Management Datastore Architecture
            (NMDA) <xref target="RFC8342"/>.  For instance, keys and associated
            certificates installed during manufacturing (e.g., for an IDevID 
            <xref target="Std-802.1AR-2009"/> certificate) are expected to appear

        <t>For the trusted-certificates list, Trust Anchor Format

              <li>For the "ietf-keystore" module, the protcol-accessible nodes

                in this diagram, all the used groupings have been expanded,
                enabling the keystore's full structure to be seen.

              <li>The reason for why "keystore-grouping" exists separate from
                the protocol-accessible nodes definition is so as to enable
                instances of the keystore to be instantiated in other
                locations, as may be needed or desired by some modules.</li>

      <section title="Support for Built-in Keys" anchor="built-ins">
        <t>In some implementations, a server may support built-in keys.  Built-in
          built-in keys MAY be set during the manufacturing process or be dynamically
          generated the first time the server is booted or a particular service
          (e.g., SSH) is enabled.</t>
        <t>The key characteristic of the built-in keys is that they are provided
          by the system, as opposed to configuration.  As such, they are present in
          &lt;operational&gt;. The example below illustrates what the keystore in
          &lt;operational&gt; might look like for a server in its factory default
          state.</t>
        <t>
          <figure>
            <artwork><![CDATA[
INSERT_TEXT_FROM_FILE(refs/ex-keystore-default-operational.xml)
]]></artwork>
          </figure>
        </t>
        <t>In order for the built-in keys (and/or their associated built-in
          certificates) to be referenced by configuration, the referenced keys
          MUST first be copied into &lt;running&gt;.  The keys SHOULD be copied
          into &lt;running&gt; using the same "key" values, so that the server
          can bind the references to the built-in entries.</t>
        <t>Built-in "hidden" keys cannot be copied into other parts of the
          configuration because their private parts are hidden, and therefore
          impossible to replicate.  Built-in "encrypted" keys MAY be copied
          into other parts of the configuration so long as they maintain their
          reference to the other built-in key that encrypted them.</t>
        <t>Only the referenced keys need to be copied; that is, the keys
          in &lt;running&gt; MAY be a subset of the built-in keys define in
          &lt;operational&gt;.  No keys may be added or changed (with exception
          to associating additional certificates to a built-in key); that is,
          the keys in &lt;running&gt; MUST be a subset (which includes the
          whole of the set) of the built-in keys define in &lt;operational&gt;.</t>
        <t>A server MUST reject attempts to modify any aspect of built-in keys,
          with exception to associating additional certificates to a built-in key.
          That these keys are "configured" in &lt;running&gt; is an illusion,
          as they are strictly a read-only subset of that which must already
          exist in &lt;operational&gt;.</t>
        <t>The following example illustrates how a single built-in key definition
          from the previous example has been propagated to &lt;running&gt;:</t>

        </t>
        <t>After the above configuration is applied, &lt;operational&gt; should appear
          as follows:</t>

      <section title="Encrypting Keys in Configuration">

        <t>This section describes an approach that enables all the private keys on a
          server to be encrypted, such that traditional backup/restore procedures
          can be used without concern for keys being compromised when in transit.</t>

        <section title="Root Key" toc="exclude">
          <t>The cornerstone to this solution is the existence of a "root" key that
            can be used to encrypt all the other keys.  The server MUST be able to
            use this key to decrypt the other keys in the configuration.</t>
          <t>The root key SHOULD be a hidden key, i.e., one whose private data has
            no presence in &lt;running&gt; or &lt;operational&gt; (see "hidden-key"
            and "hidden-private-key" in "ietf-crypto-types"
            <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>).  If the server
            implementation does not support hidden keys, then the private data part
            of key MUST be protected by access control with access granted only to
            an administrator with special access control rights (e.g., an
            organization's crypto officer).  Given the long lifetime of built-in
            keys (see <xref target="built-ins"/>), built-in keys MUST be hidden.</t>
          <t>A hidden root key MAY be either a symmetric key or an asymmetric key.  If
            the hidden root key is symmetric, then the server MUST provide APIs enabling
            other keys (ideally generated by the server) to be encrypted.  If the
            hidden root key is asymmetric, then the server SHOULD provide APIs enabling
            other keys to be both generated and encrypted by it, but MAY alternatively
            enable administrators with special access control rights to generate and
            encrypt the other keys themselves, using the hidden key's public part.
            For practical reasons, an unhidden root key SHOULD be asymmetric, so that
            its public part can be accessed by other administrators without concern.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Configuring Encrypting Keys" toc="exclude">
          <t>Each time a new key is to be configured, it SHOULD be encrypted by the
            root key.</t>
          <t>In "ietf-crypto-types" <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>,
            the format for an encrypted symmetric key is described by the
            "encrypted-one-symmetric-key-format" identity, while the format
            for an encrypted asymmetric key is described by the 
            "encrypted-one-asymmetric-key-format" identity</t>
          <t>Ideally, the server implementation provides an API to generate a 
            symmetric or asymmetric key, and encrypt the generated key using
            another key known to the system (e.g., the root key).  Thusly
            administrators can safely call this API to configure new keys.</t>
          <t>In case the server implementation does not provide such an API, then
            the generating and encrypting steps MAY be performed outside the
            server, e.g., by an administrator with special access control rights.</t>
          <t>In either case, the encrypted key can be configured into the Keystore
            using either the "encrypted-key" (for symmetric keys) or the 
            "encrypted-private-key" (for asymmetric keys) nodes.  These two nodes
            contain both the encrypted value as well as a reference to the other
            key in the Keystore that it was encrypted by.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="Migrating Configuration to Another Server" toc="exclude">
          <t>In the case a server's root key is used to encrypt other keys,
            migrating the configuration to another server may entail additional
            effort, assuming the second server has a different root key than the
            first server, in order for the second server to decrypt the other
            encrypted keys.</t>
          <t>In some deployments, mechanisms outside the scope of this document
            may be used to migrate the root key from one server to another.
            That said, beware that the ability to do so typically entails having
            access to the first server but, in many RMA scenarios, the first server
            may no longer be operational.</t>
          <t>Another option is to introduce a "shared root" key that acts as
            a portable intermediate root key.  This shared root key would only
            need to be known to an organization's crypto officer.  The shared
            root key SHOULD be encrypted offline by the crypto officer using
            each server's public key, which may be, e.g., in the server's
            IDevID certificate.  The crypto officer can then safely handoff
            the encrypted shared key to other administrators responsible for
            server installations, including migrations.  In order to migrate
            configuration from a first server, an administrator would need to
            make just a single modification to the configuration before loading it
            onto a second server, which is to replace the shared key's Keystore
            entry from the first server (an encrypted key), with the shared key
            encrypted by the second server's root key.  The following diagram
            illustrates this idea:</t>

        <section title="Data at Rest">
          <t>The YANG module defined in this document defines a mechanism called a
            "keystore" that, by its name, suggests that it will protect its
            contents from unauthorized disclosure and modification.</t>
          <t>Security controls for the API (i.e., data in motion) are
            discussed in <xref target="sec-mod"/>, but controls for the
            data at rest cannot be specified by the YANG module.</t>
          <t>In order to satisfy the expectations of a "keystore", it
            is RECOMMENDED that implementations ensure that the keystore
            contents are encrypted when persisted to non-volatile memory.</t>
        </section>

        <section title="The &quot;ietf-keystore&quot; YANG Module" anchor="sec-mod">
          <t>The YANG module defined in this document is designed to be accessed via YANG
            based management protocols, such as NETCONF <xref target="RFC6241"/> and
            RESTCONF <xref target="RFC8040"/>.  Both of these protocols have mandatory-to-implement
            secure transport layers (e.g., SSH, TLS) with mutual authentication.</t>
   
          <t>The NETCONF access control model (NACM) <xref target="RFC8341"/> provides the means
            to restrict access for particular users to a pre-configured subset of all available
            protocol operations and content.</t>

          <t>None of the readable data nodes defined in this YANG module are considered sensitive
            or vulnerable in network environments. The NACM "default-deny-all" extension
            has not been set for any data nodes defined in this module.</t>
          <aside>
            <t>Please be aware that this module uses the "key" and "private-key"
              nodes from the "ietf-crypto-types" module <xref target="I-D.ietf-netconf-crypto-types"/>,
              where said nodes have the NACM extension "default-deny-all" set, thus
              preventing unrestricted read-access to the cleartext key values.</t>
          </aside>

          <t>All of the writable data nodes defined by this module, both in the
            "grouping" statements as well as the protocol-accessible "keystore"
            instance, may be considered sensitive or vulnerable in some network
            environments..  For instance, any modification to a key or reference
            to a key  may dramatically alter the implemented security policy.
            For this reason, the NACM extension "default-deny-write" has been
            set for all data nodes defined in this module.</t>
 
          <t>This module does not define any RPCs, actions, or notifications, and thus the
          security consideration for such is not provided here.</t>
